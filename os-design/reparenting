setprpp(int set) /* set process reparenting point */

	When a process dies its children should reparent to the closes
	ancestor who has called `setprpp` and did so the last time
	with set != 0.
	
	I immagine that could be useful for something, but it is mostly
	about having a clean process tree.
	
	I think valgrind uses this in Linux. It appears that Linux does
	support this: `man 2 prctl` PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER
