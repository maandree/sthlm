SIGDANGER

	Nothing too new. When the system is running out of memory
	it notifies process by sending a SIGDANGER signal to them
	in order to urge them to free up memory they are not using.


SIGINFO

	Nothing too new here either. Request that the process
	prints its status to stderr.


SIGUPDATE

	Just like SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2, except the default action
	is to ignore it. Its purpose is to have standard signal
	to send to process that should re-exec into a newer version
	of their executable.


SIGPARENT

	Just like SIGCHLD, except reversed. When a process's parent
	process dies this signal is raised at the child.
	This can be used to esculate death to children. The children
	should of cause be able to get the parents exist status.

	It appears that Linux can do this, but the signal is
	configurable: `man 2 prctrl` PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, PR_GET_PDEATHSIG
