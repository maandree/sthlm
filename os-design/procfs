/proc/$$/pub

	A directory associated with a process.
	The process with the process ID $$ can
	do anything in this directory that it
	could do in any other normal tmpfs
	directory. However, other process can
	only read and execute files in this
	directory (to the extent the files'
	permission bits allow.) Process owned
	by any used can access this directory.
