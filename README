Spellbinding treatful hobbyists' laboratorial microkernel (Sthlm /stockholm/)

I'm trying to write a microkernel. Because, well, it's fun.
I have choosen to write everything in C (except parts that need
to be in assembly) because C is fun and I am^H^Hwas doing too
little in it. That said, real projects should seldomly be
written in C, C++ or assembly and kernels should perferably
be written in Haskell.
