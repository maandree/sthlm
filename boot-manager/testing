These instructions are for x86 master boot record (MBR).

To test the boot manager create a QEMU machine that boot
into a bootloader (you know, that graphical program from
which to select kernel too boot; the boot manager boots
the bootloader.)

The machine's disc image must use raw formatting, otherwise
the following steps will not work as they should.

So that the makefile will work, the disc should be located
in the directory ‘.machine’ and should be named ‘disc.raw’.
You may want to create a backup:

    cp disc.raw backup.raw


To install a new boot manager to ‘disc.raw’ run:

    dd if=YOUR_MBR_FILE_OR_DISC of=disc.raw \
       bs=440 count=1 conv=notrunc
