A boot manager is a (really) tiny program that is installed
to the beginning of a disc. Its mission in life is to find
a bootable partition and boot it. The bootable partition
normally contain a bootloader, but could also contain another
boot manager or a kernel.

Since booting logical partitions is ridiculous, bootmanagers
in this project will only be able to boot primary and extended
partitions.

Additionally, it should be possible to compile to either boot
the first bootable partition or the last bootable partition.
Normally partitioners will only let you have one bootable
partition but you can actually flag all your partitions
(including the logical once that we do not boot) to be bootable,
which is (combined with booting the last bootable partition) a
great trick to do boot sequence hacks.
