This is a list of ideas that I ultimelty want the implement in my OS.


SIGPARENT

	Just like SIGCHLD, except reversed. When a process's parent
	process dies the kernel will send this signal to the child.
	This can be used to esculate death to children. The children
	should of cause be able to get the parents exist status.

setprpp(int set) /* set process reparenting point */

	When a process it's children should reparent to the closes
	ancestor who has called `setprpp` and did so the last time
	with set != 0.

I_SENDFD, I_RECVFD

	I want my OS to support file descriptor passing over
	STREAMS-based pipes.

I_SENDCHLD, I_RECVCHLD

	A process should be able to send a child processes to
	another process. This means that the child process is
	reparented to the receiving process when these calls
	have returned.

Immortal processes

	A process can set configure itself to be immortal
	(should be done between `fork` and `exec`), which means
	that when it dies, rather than getting reaped at
	`wait` the parent can resurrect it, or choose to reap
	it. For compatibility with other systems and simplicity
	for must programs, reaping is done by default.
	The reason for letting the process configure itself
	as immortal rather than having the parent keep track
	of which processes immortal is simple: if the process
	its reparented, for instance because it parent died,
	the new parent will know it should resurrect it unless
	it exited with status 0. Furthermore, immortal processes
	where automatically resurrected upon abnormal death
	we would not be able to (nicely) implement policies
	for reaping it if it dies too quickly too often.
	An immortal process will appear to be alive for all
	process but the parent, unless you snoop in /proc:
	file descriptors are not closed, the PID is reserved
	for the immortal process, nothing changes. Not even
	child process will get notified.
	
	Rather that the signature for `main` being
	(int argc, char* argv[], char** envp) it is
	(int argc, char* argv[], char** envp, spawn_flags_t** flags)
	in sthlm. Where spawn_flags_t is an integer.
	For a resurrected process P_RESURRECTED will be set
	in `flags`. Additionally, the parent may choose to
	resurrect the process and urge it properly release
	global resource and otherwise clean up after itself,
	in this case P_CLEANUP will also be set in `flags`.
	A process with `flags & P_CLEANUP` should not
	continue its actions, it should only clean up after
	itself and exit.
	
	Immortal processes are important for one reason:
	kernel servers should not lose important resources
	and should never appear to be dead or crash the
	system by dying. But that can also be used for
	non-kernel servers.
